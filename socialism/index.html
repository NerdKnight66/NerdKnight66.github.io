            Imagine a child born to rich parents, Bob. Bob has incredibly wealthy parents, so wealthy that he could live a life where he never works and still be comfortable. None of his wealth comes from skill, it's all inheritance.
    Bob then decides he wants to make a company out of the 300 million dollar trust fund given to him by his parents. So he calls up his friend Tim to help him find business plans.

            Tim started in the slums, he's one of the very few people in his area who was able to make it. He's a hard worker, don't get me wrong. But he wasn't even the hardest. He just got lucky to be friends with Bob.
    Tim puts up a listing, sends out requests, advertises the opportunity and runs all the pitch meetings. He sifts through hundreds of pitches before he finds an idea he believes to have promise.
    His work here is invaluable to the eventual operation of the company that shall be built, which I'm telling you now, will go on to be worth billions, maybe trillions in time.
    If he was not there the company would not exist. But Bob won't pay him what his work is worth, he will only pay him $3 million.
    Tim is forced to accept being underpaid for his work, because he couldn't do this on his own. He doesn't have the $300 million dollars needed to start the business.
    Tim takes the $3 million, because he is in a system that won't let him do any better.

            Sarah is the entrepreneur who pitched the idea that was ultimately successful. Her plan is for a motorcycle manufacturer, and it's very detailed. She's had this idea since childhood, she's drawn pictures of logos in scrapbooks since grade school, and studied engineering and even built her own engine from scratch as a side project.
    Her plan details everything from branding to initial products to supply chains and factory set-up. She lists people she's met through networking who she trusts to form the board of this company to see the plan to completion
    Her plans are what's going to make so much money, billions, for Bob.
    She should be able to receive those billions for her genius ambition, but Tim only negotiates for Bob to give her a $10 million payout.
    Don't get me wrong, 10 million dollars is a lot of money. But it's such a fraction of a fraction of what her work is really worth. But Bob has what she needs for her plan to work. Initial capital.
    Sarah takes the $10 million, because she is in a system that won't let her do any better.

            Tim leases a floor of an office building and a board of executives is hired. These are the people who are going to be making the decisions about the company.
    They are responsible for enacting Sarah's plan, with Tim serving as a representative for Bob (who doesn't care to attend board meetings), and for continuing the operation of the company after that.
    They are the people who really organise this whole thing. Up until now this company has been a far off idea floating around in someone's head; they're going to make it real.
    They review and purchase land to build factories on, hire construction companies and marketing experts, and assemble the backbone of this business.
    These people deserve to split profits equally amongst themselves, but instead their salary is orders of magnitude less.
    But Bob gave them the $300 million they needed to start the company, so to Bob the biggest slice of the pie goes
    The board takes their salary, because they're in a system that won't let them do any better.

            The construction company and the marketing agency get to work building this corporation. The construction workers making the factory, the marketing agency creating a brand.
Without the factory and it's equipment built and supplied by the workers in the building company, none of the products they would go on to sell would be able to be made.
Without the labour of the office workers building websites and advertising, organising suppliers and connections, drafting new product designs and more, no one would want to buy from their upstart brand.
If the board was the backbone of this company, these workers are building the veins and tendons and organs. But they won't get paid that way
The workers can't build this factory on their own, because all the necessary equipment is so cost-prohibitive that the company they work for can pay them less than their worth, because they can't afford the means to do this by themselves. The office workers can't make this brand even all together, because they all don't have the money to continuously pour into it until it turns a profit.
The hundreds of hard workers accept a 5-figure pay with minimal benefits, because they're in a system that won't let them do any better.

            And now, with all this infrastructure and everything built, we find the factory worker.
They make the product. They create the value. Everything up until now has been creating a monopoly on who owns the tools and land and materials they need to do their job so that Bob can squeeze every last ounce out of these workers as they can.
And who do we find here but Tim. Tim fell back on hard times. Bob's payment of $3 million disappeared in an instant when Tim slipped and shattered his spine 4 months ago. 
Tim didn't have health insurance, and was forced to pay for the procedure out of pocket. It completely bankrupted him.
With raggedy clothes and not a dollar to his name, Tim applied for the only job he could think of.
Tim works on a conveyer line, making grommets for motorcycle engines at Bob's company. Even though Tim can make 3,000 of his little plastic tubes every hour, he has to work for an hour to afford 3 of them.
You would think that if Tim can make so many, why can't he just go to someone else. He's being robbed of 99.9% of the value he produces.

        <h3>The answer is simple.</h3>
        <h2>Tim takes his minimum wage, <strong>because he's in a system that won't let him do any better.</strong></h3>
